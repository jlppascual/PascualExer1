                    <div class ="answer"> My favorite cmsc subject so far is CMSC 22 because I enjoyed
                        having a visual representation of how the code works. Moreover, I also do enjoy 
                        creating and making an application work properly. Perhaps my enjoyment in this subject
                        can also be related to my appreciation and interest in games and somehow, this subject 
                        so far is the closest or works as a startup to creating applications.

                    <div class ="answer"> My favorite elective so far is KAS 1. I was interested in knowing what 
                        notable events took place in the early years which gave birth to the world we know today.
                        Moreover, our professor in this subject was very knowledgeable and at the same time enter-
                        taining that the subject became enjoyable to learn.

                    <div class ="question" id="thirdpage">Favorite programming language so far</div>
                    <div class ="answer"> My favorite programming language so far is Javascript because of interactive
                        elements that allows the user to engage with the web pages. Moreover, it is also the language used
                        by my favorite CMSC subject so far thus I have more patience checking codes line per line in eclipse
                        compared to other programming languages and applications so far.
